# LSHTM SPI-M scenario modeling

## What

- Renewal equation based method as an extension of the first example with the addition of an adjustment for the proportion of the population that were susceptible.
- Compartmental model approach with significant internal model complexity
- Submitted to SPI-M by independent teams with the renewal equation based method no longer being used from January 2021

## Known limitations

- Renewal based approach assumed that the observed reproduction number was constant, aside from reductions due to susceptible depletion, into the future.

## Unknown limitations

## Causes

- Independent data, computational, and validation pipelines within LSHTM with little to no overlap.
- Similarly independent pipelines across groups

## Mitigation

- Scenarios were modelled by multiple independent teams and then collaboratively discussed potentially reducing the impact of issues though also potentially resulting in herding. However, it is likely that the issues we experienced were also problems for other groups which may have reduced the benefit of this ensemble approach as all models likely to make similar simplifications.
