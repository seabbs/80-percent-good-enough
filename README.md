# What is 80% good enough for real-time analyses during the COVID-19 pandemic

**Aim:** Explore the factors, with real-world examples from our work, that limited the quality of real-time COVID-19 research.

**Audience:**

- Funders
- Researchers producing real-time analyses

**Length:** ~ 1000 words + 200 for the abstract. Currently at ~ 1500 without additional examples.

**Venue:** As similar in many ways to "The COVID-19 response illustrates that traditional academic reward structures and metrics do not reflect crucial contributions to modern science" perhaps PLOS Biology. Any other thoughts are very welcome.
