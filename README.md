# What is 80% good enough for real-time analyses during the COVID-19 pandemic

**Aim:** Explore the factors, with real-world examples from our work, that limited the quality of real-time COVID-19 research.

**Audience:**

- Funders
- Researchers producing real-time analyses

**Length:** 1400 words (7 paragraphs each of 200 words) for text and 250 words for the abstract. We may need to cut this down at a later date.

**Venue:** As similar in many ways to "The COVID-19 response illustrates that traditional academic reward structures and metrics do not reflect crucial contributions to modern science" perhaps PLOS Biology. Any other thoughts are very welcome.

**See `letter.md` for the draft text.**
